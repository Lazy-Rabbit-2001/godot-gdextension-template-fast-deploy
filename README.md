# Godot Cpp Template with Docs
This repository is a fan-extended version of [original Godot Cpp Template](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp-template). About detailed information, please check this link.

## What's optimized in this version?
* Added support for custom documentation for classes.
* Deployed an example h/cpp file for starting.

## Before you start
* Make sure you have installed [Godot](https://godotengine.org/download) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). (Of course you can use any other IDE or text editor, but here we will use Visual Studio Code as an example.)
* Clone this repository to your local machine.
* Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
* Rename all "example"s to your extension name.
